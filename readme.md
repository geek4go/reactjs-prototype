# SilverStripe CMS + ReactJS

This is a _very_ bare bones prototype used to demonstrate some of the ideas we're putting forward around using ReactJS in the CMS.

## Install

Only required if you want to hack around with the code.

- Get the dependencies with `npm install`
- Build your changes with `npm run build`

## Usage

Start a dev server from the root directory `php -S localhost:8000`
